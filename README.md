# VeriDraw
VeriDraw is a web-based circuit designer for creating verilog designs by drawing diagrams.
Users can draw their circuit by dragging in basic function blocks (adders, multipliers, registers, etc.) and connecting them together.

This is currently a WIP, a lot of stuff might change.

## Roadmap
This is definitely subject to change, but the current roadmap is:
- get a working prototype with basic functionality (add/subtract, multiply, registers/memory)
    - this should also include the ability to view the generated verilog and export it
    - this should also allow saving/loading of diagram project files
- add ability to import verilog
    - this might be *difficult* and may get pushed down
- add ability to use multiple modules, include modules inside of other modules
